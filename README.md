# ICDM_2025_LatexFC
This is a repository for our project LatexFC that has been accepted by ICDM 2025

## Overview  
ICDM_2025_LatexFC is a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework that automates the conversion of LaTeX manuscripts across heterogeneous publisher-specific templates (IEEE, MDPI, Springer, Elsevier, etc.).  
By integrating **prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and structured validation**, the system reduces tedious manual formatting while preserving semantic content and ensuring compilable outputs.  

## Motivation  
Academic publishing often requires authors to strictly follow different LaTeX templates such as IEEE, MDPI, or Springer. Reformatting manuscripts manually across these styles is tedious, error-prone, and demands significant time and expertise. Existing solutions, such as template-specific scripts, are rigid and frequently fail when dealing with complex documents that include citations, figures, or multi-section structures.  

ICDM_2025_LatexFC addresses these challenges by leveraging large language models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation. The system reduces manual effort, ensures compilable and accurate LaTeX outputs, and allows researchers to focus more on the quality of their scientific work instead of repetitive formatting tasks.  

## Capabilities  
- Provides an automated LaTeX format conversion platform, allowing authors to seamlessly adapt manuscripts to different publisher templates without tedious manual reformatting.  
- Utilizes large language models with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation to preserve document structure and ensure that outputs remain compilable and compliant with target styles.  
- Enhances academic productivity by bridging the gap between complex formatting requirements and practical usability, making cross-template LaTeX conversion efficient, reliable, and accessible for researchers.  

## Key Features  
- **Automated Format Conversion**: Converts LaTeX manuscripts seamlessly across major publisher templates, including IEEE, MDPI, Springer, and Elsevier.  
- **LLM-Powered Transformation**: Employs advanced large language models with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation to ensure accurate and compliant outputs.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Includes configuration management, input pre-processing, RAG core, and post-processing modules for scalability and reliability.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive workflow with step-by-step guidance for model selection, template choice, and manuscript upload, producing ready-to-compile outputs.  
- **Validation & Reliability**: Built-in post-processing ensures compilable LaTeX code, preserving structure and reducing errors in the final manuscript.
